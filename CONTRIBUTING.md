============
The project is considered _mostly_ feature-complete, but there remain
bugs to be discovered and ironed out,
the open question of the optimal/best global optimization algorithm,
which the project will strive to implement, as well as any small
[TODOs and FIXMEs](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Asambo-optimization%2Fsambo+%28todo+OR+fixme+OR+xxx%29&type=code)
already marked in the source.


Bugs & Issues
-------------
When you report a bug, please include a minimal reproducible example,
i.e. a short snippet of code that deterministically reproduces
and shows off the bug.

See:
* https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example
* https://matthewrocklin.com/minimal-bug-reports.html

Ideally, send in your bug reports with patches to fix
and tests to cover.
Thsnks!
